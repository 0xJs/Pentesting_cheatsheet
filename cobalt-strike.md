# Cobalt-Strike cheatsheet.

#### Start teamserver
```
cd /opt/cobaltstrike
./teamserver 10.10.5.120 Passw0rd!
```

#### Create a listener
- Cobalt Strike --> Listeners -->  Click the Add button and a New Listener dialogue will appear.
- Choose a descriptive name such as ```<protocol>-<port>``` example: ```http-80```.
- Set the variables and click Save.

#### Create a payload
- OPSEC: Staged payloads are good if your delivery method limits the amount of data you can send. However, they tend to have more indicators compared to stageless. Given the choice, go stageless.
- OPSEC: The use of 64-bit payloads on 64-bit Operating Systems is preferable to using 32-bit payloads on 64-bit Operating Systems.
- Attacks --> Packages --> Windows Executable (S).
